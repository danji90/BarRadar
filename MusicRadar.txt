MusicRadar

This mobile app is designed to geolocate the user using the Google maps API
and search for venues playing music (like, bars, music schools, concert halls etc) in a predefined search 
radius radius. It uses the foursquare API, the category (music) and the radius are specified in the API's URL.
One of the main challenges was finding a useful API and understanding how to use it. Another was to use 
the Google maps API to embed the map in the "map view page", the main problem being the correct definition 
of the loading sequence correctly so that it wouldn't conflict with the "back" button. Also adding and centering 
the markers proved to be quite a challenge. 
One more tricky problem to solve was the "order by" function with the flipswitch. This literally took me all night
to figure out, eventually understanding the simplicity of the issue and implementing it effectively.

You can find the app on the free hosting service:
